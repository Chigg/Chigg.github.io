## Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
#### Relationship with the NGO Sector: 

The LTTE’s relationship with various NGOs during the period of its existence is rather complicated. The LTTE utilized a number of NGOs globally to gather funding through the Tamil diaspora. One specific NGO, the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization (TRO) acted to rehabilitate the areas disrupted by war and to provide relief. The TRO worked synchronously with the goals established by the LTTE’s official civil service wing, the Tamil Eelam Economic Development Organization (TEEDOR). Other organizations operating outside of Sri Lanka covertly supported the LTTE as fronts. Examples of such organizations according to the Sri Lankan government are Global Tamil Forum, Tamil Youth Organization, and the World Tamil Movement.

Within Sri Lanka, foreign INGOs were at risk of predatory behavior from both the LTTE and the Sri Lanka army. NGOs operating within conflict zones were constantly at risk of retaliation from either side. If in LTTE territory, they were targeted by Sri Lankan military for supporting the LTTE and vice versa. On numerous occasions, non-profit workers were found executed with provisions stolen. This is supported by The Aid Worker Security Database and numerous other resources within the literature review for this project.

#### Relationship with other FTOs: 

The LTTE had a number of interactions with various other FTOs. Contact was facilitated largely because of the scale of its global network. Early on, the LTTE trained alongside the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) alongside other Tamil groups in the 70’s, such as the Eelam Revolutionary Organization of Students (EROS). This early relationship corresponds with an initial declaration of support for various other global separatist organizations attempting independence.

The LTTE had multiple connections with other FTOs in the 90s. They shipped weapons to the Harakat-al Mujahideen and the Abu Sayyaf Group on a couple of occasions, using their shipping network and global ties to distribute arms. They also received support from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in the form of surface to air missiles. They maintained a connection in Eritrea as a means to distribute excess arms, and as a result likely held contact with armed groups affiliated with Al Qaeda, who also operated in the area. Even after the Sri Lankan government claimed victory over the LTTE in 2009, they pursued eliminating remaining LTTE assets in Eritrea.

#### Relationship with the State: 

Considering the LTTE is a separatist organization, naturally they have had poor relations with the Sri Lankan government. For much of the organization’s life, the  organization has been in constant conflict with the Sri Lankan government as a result of their desire to separate. However, in 2002 with support from both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government, 20 delegates from Norway and 10 from Iceland mediated  a ceasefire under the name of the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission (SLMM). This represented a conscious effort from both the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government to bring about a peaceful solution, as well as a relationship with a new set of foreign state actors (Norway / Iceland). As a result of the effort, the LTTE received a bit more notoriety and diplomatic legitimacy as an actor in it’s own right. Their de facto control territory was more or less also legitimized by the SLMM. The LTTE used this ceasefire as a means to silence their opposition violently, and generate revenue. A criticism of the SLMM was that it resulted in both the Sri Lankan Government and the peace committee turning a blind eye in the name of peace. There were numerous instances of human rights abuses on both sides. The ceasefire was short lived. In 2008 the Sri Lankan government pulled out, and by 2009 they were fully aimed at defeating the LTTE.
